# Lifeguard (Alpha)

Lifeguard: Manage and monitor pools of virtual server resources across Open Nebula instances.

# What is Lifeguard?

A Python (3.4+) web application that simplifies administration of pooled virtual resources across disparate Open Nebula (ON) installations by grouping VMs into pools.

Lifeguard allows administrators to provide 'zone' details for ON instances (user name/password, API URL, etc) and then:

* Distribute virtual machine images to supported target datastores
* Group VMs in ON clusters into pools
* Define templates and variables in a hierarchical structure zone -> cluster -> pool -> virtual machine
* Instantiate arbitrary VMs with a zone/cluster/pool template

# Road map

* Automated pool updates after template/variable updates
* Monitor and query health checks of managed virtual machines

# ALPHA CODE

* Warning: this is alpha code.  While the existing functionality is currently stable the interfaces and code is being updated frequently and there are few unit tests.

# Building 

This project requires Python 3.4.  It may work with 3.5 however only 3.4 has been tested.
